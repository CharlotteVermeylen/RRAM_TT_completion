This repository provides the code to reproduce the results in the manuscript:

C. Vermeylen and M. Van Barel, A Riemannian rank-adaptive method for higher-order tensor completion in the tensor-train format. Arxiv (2024)

More specifically, the folder `manopt' containts code from:

Boumal, N., Mishra, B., Absil, P.-A., and Sepulchre, R. Manopt,
a Matlab toolbox for optimization on manifolds. Journal of Machine
Learning Research 15, 42 (2014), 1455–1459.

And the forlder `RRAM_higher_dim' contains our own implemented functions and scripts. The code from manopt is among others necessary to compare the performance of the algorithm with. More specifically, we compare the performance of the Riemannian rank-adaptive method (RRAM) 'RRAM_TT_completion_gen.m' with the RRAM implemented in 'completion_rankincrease.m', which is part of the manopt software package and originates from the TTeMPS Matlab toolbox implemented by Michael Steinlechner. This function corresponds to the proposed algorithm in:

Steinlechner, M. Riemannian optimization for high-dimensional tensor
completion. SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing 38, 5 (2016), S461–
S484.

For a fair comparison in terms of rank adaptation, the proposed RRAM 'RRAM_TT_completion_gen.m' and 'completion_rankincrease.m' both use the same Riemannian conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm to optimize on the smooth manifold of tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank. This function is implemented in 'completion_orth.m' and is also part of manopt and originates from the TTeMPS toolbox.
